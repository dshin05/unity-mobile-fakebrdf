SHADER SOURCE GUIDE
================
All variations of Marmoset shaders are built in ShaderLab using a core set of Marmoset include files, written in Cg, and included with full source for reference and customization. They can be found in the Marmoset/Shader/ folder as:
MarmosetCore - Shader math and RGBM code

MarmosetInput.cginc - Material parameters and input structures for ShaderLab shaders

MarmosetDirect.cginc - Direct lighting function for ShaderLab. Omni, direct, and spot-light results are computed here.

MarmosetSurf.cginc - Surface Lighting function for ShaderLab. Image-based lighting and texture lookups are performed here.

MarmosetMobile.cginc - Contains preprocessor commands for detecting and configuring Marmoset shaders for mobile platforms.

The .shader files (Bumped Diffuse IBL.shader, etc) themselves don't contain any real math. They simply include these .cginc files and use #defines to configure them for the a desired feature set.


#DEFINE FEATURES
---
#define MARMO_HQ
High-quality mode adds extra vector normalization and more rigorous lighting math to a few places in the shader. Disabled on mobile.

#define MARMO_SKY_ROTATION
Rotates reflection and normal vectors by a sky transform matrix passed in by sky objects. This is performed in the fragment shader and is costly. Diabled on mobile.

#define MARMO_DIFFUSE_IBL
Enables a lookup into the diffuse image-based lighting cubemap.

#define MARMO_SPECULAR_IBL
Enables a lookup into the specular image-based lighting cubemap.

#define MARMO_DIFFUSE_DIRECT
Enables diffuse contributions from direct light sources such as point and directional lights.

#define MARMO_SPECULAR_DIRECT
Enables specular contributions from direct light sources such as point and directional lights.

#define MARMO_NORMALMAP
Adds a normal-mapping texture lookup and math to the fragment shader.

#define MARMO_MIP_GLOSS 
A SPECULAR_IBL feature that uses the specular sharpness material property to look into a specific mip level of the specular image-based lighting cubemap.
Note: Disable on hardware that does not support textureCubeLod texture lookups.

#define MARMO_GLOW
Adds a glow map texture lookup and math for self illuminating surfaces.

#define MARMO_PREMULT_ALPHA
Premultiplies OUT.Albedo.rgb by OUT.Alpha, to be used with a premultipled-alpha blending mode. This option does NOT premultiply the specular output, so the specular component of the surface is blended additively (See Simple Glass shader).

The four main variations of shaders: Diffuse, Specular, Bumped Diffuse, and Bumped Specular IBL are included with full source as an example of how to configure the .cginc headers. The remaining 30+ shader variations come precompiled but can easily be recreated in the same fashion.


MULTI_COMPILE
---
There is one other preprocessor directive that must be present in all shaders:
#pragma multi_compile MARMO_LINEAR MARMO_GAMMA

This tells the ShaderLab compiler to build two versions of every shader, one with #define MARMO_LINEAR and one with #define MARMO_GAMMA. In code, the Sky.cs script picks between the two depending on the project's color-space configuration. These #defines are used in several places to perform math and RGBM decoding in the proper color-space.
